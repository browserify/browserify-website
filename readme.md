# Browserify-website

The static site that is http://browserify.org

CSS forked from https://github.com/the-gss/the-gss.github.io

## Contributing

We like pull requests that:

- Add meaningful new content
- Fix bugs in modern browsers
- Improve visual design
- Make browserify easier to understand/use/get started with

Please don't send pull requests that do the following:

- Reorganize css
- Roptimize images
- Refactor without making any substantive changes to the website

The browserify website currently does its job well and doesn't have any scaling problems. The overhead of merging in small pull requests often just isn't worth it for us. 
Sorry!
